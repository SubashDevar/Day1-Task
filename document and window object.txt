
DOCUMENT OBJECT:

The Document interface represents any web page loaded in the browser and serves as an entry point 
into the web page's content, which is the DOM tree. When an HTML document is loaded into a web browser ,
it becomes a document object. It is the root node of the HTML document.
The document actually gets loaded inside the window object and has properties available to it like
title, URL, cookie, etc. HTML documents, served with the "text/html" content type, 
also implement the HTMLDocument interface, whereas XML and SVG documents implement the XMLDocument interface.

By accessing the document object, we can access the element in the HTML page. 
With the help of document objects, we can add dynamic content to our web page.
The document object can be accessed with a 	

window.document or just document.

Syntax:

document.property_name;

Some Of the Properties of Document:

activeElement: It returns the currently active elements in the document.

body: It returns the contents of the body element.

anchors: It returns all <a> elements that have a name attribute.

baseURI: It returns a string value that represents the base URI of the document.

cookie: It returns the cookie of the current document.

charSet: It returns a string, representing the documentâ€™s character encoding.

defaultView: It returns the current Window Object.

designMode: It is used to set documents as editable or read-only.


Some Of the Methods of Document:


addEventListener(): It is used to attach an event handler to the specified element.

adoptNode(): It is used to adopt a node from another document and it returns a node object, representing the adopted node.

close(): It is used to close the output stream.

createAttribute(): It is used to create an attribute node with the specified name and returns the attribute object.

createComment(): It is used to create a comment node with some text.

createDocumentFragment(): It is used to create the document fragment to change the content of the document.

createElement(): It is used to create HTML element .

createEvent(): It is used to create a new events object.

Syntax:

document.method_name;


The JavaScript window object sits at the top of the JavaScript Object hierarchy and represents the browser window. 
The window object is supported by all browsers. All global JavaScript objects , functions, and variables automatically become members of the window object. 
The window is the first thing that gets loaded into the browser .This window object has the majority of the properties like 
length, innerWidth, innerHeight, name, if it has been closed, its parents, and more.



The window object represents the current browsing context .It holds things like window.location, window.history, window.screen, window.status, or the window.document . 
Each browser tab has its own top-level window object. Each of these windows gets its own separate global object. window.window always refers to window, but window.
parent and window.top might refer to enclosing windows, giving access to other execution contexts. Moreover,the window property of a window object points to the window object itself.


The window object is supported by all browsers. It represents the browser's window.

All global JavaScript objects, functions, and variables automatically become members of the window object.

Global variables are properties of the window object.

Global functions are methods of the window object.

Even the document object (of the HTML DOM) is a property of the window object:




Some Of the Properties of Window:

SYNTAX:

window.document.property name  (Or)  document.property name


Document- It returns the document object for the window (DOM).

Frames- It returns an array of all the frames including iframes in the current window.

Closed- It returns the boolean value indicating whether a window has been closed or not.

History- It returns the history object for the window.

innerHeight- It sets or returns the inner height of a window's content area.

innerWidth- It sets or returns the inner width of a window's content area.

Length- It returns the number of frames in a window.

Location- It returns the location object for the window.

Name- It sets or returns the name of a window.

Navigator- It returns the navigator object for the window.


Some Of the Methods of Window:

SYNTAX:

window.document.Method name  (Or)  document.Method name


alert()- It displays an alert box.

confirm()- It displays a dialog box.

prompt()- It displays a dialog box that prompts the visitor for input.

setInterval()- It calls a function or evaluates an expression at specified intervals.

setTimeout()- It evaluates an expression after a specified number of milliseconds.

clearInterval()- It clears a timer specified by setInterval().

clearTimeOut()- It clears a timer specified by setTimeout().

close()- It closes the current window.

open()- It opens a new browser window.



Window Vs Document:

Window object : It is the top most object and outermost element of the object hierarchy 



The window object represents a window/tab containing a DOM document where as
document object is property of window object that points to the DOM document loaded in that window.


You can access a document object either using window.document property or using document object
directly as window is global object. In the below example, title is the property of document object.

The other major difference is that both window object and document object have properties and methods.
Few method names are same in both objects but with different behavior.
